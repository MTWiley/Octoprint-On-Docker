### PETG Notes

Take a PLA Profile that works for you:
-   Turn up the temp to ~230-260 degrees
-   __Turn down the parts cooling fan (Min 20-50% Max)__

Retration Modification:
-   Increase retract 2-3 mm for Bowden or 1 mm for Direct
-   Play with retract speed

Strings frequently
Make travel speed as fast as possible.
Use an adhesive so that it doesn't pull chunks out of your glass.

Dry in the oven at 60C
