## PETG Notes

### Printing Profile:
Use a basic PLA profile that works for you:
-   Turn up the temp to ~230-260 degrees
-   __Turn down the parts cooling fan (Min 20-50% Max)__
-   Modify Retraction Settings:
    -   Increase retract 2-3 mm for Bowden or 1 mm for Direct
    -   Play with retract speed
-   Make travel speed as fast as possible.

### General Notes
-   Strings frequently
-   Use an adhesive so that it doesn't pull chunks out of your glass.
-   If you run into issues try drying your filament in the oven at 60C
